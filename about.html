  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
  I am an ML / AI Engineer with over 8 years of experience delivering
  machine learning systems for decision-critical use cases across
  banking, media, healthcare, and digital platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
  My work focuses on building production-grade ML solutions —
  balancing performance, interpretability, governance, and
  business impact — rather than experimental or purely research-driven models.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Background</h2>

  <p>
  I have led and contributed to ML initiatives within large global organizations,
  working closely with engineering, product, risk, and operations teams
  to ensure models translate into real-world outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Education & Research</h2>

  <p>
  I hold dual Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Engineering from
  the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, with academic exchange
  experience at the Technical University of Munich.
  </p>

  <p>
  My academic work includes published research in medical imaging using
  deep learning and applied computer vision systems for autonomous environments.
